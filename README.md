In this project, I developed several fundamental DSP modules entirely from scratch in MATLAB, 
without using built-in functions like fft, fftshift, or freqz. I wrote a custom DTFT function to 
analyze magnitude and phase responses of different discrete signals and used it to study their 
frequency-domain behavior. 
I also implemented compressor and expander blocks to simulate time-scaling and examined 
how these operations change the spectrum and can lead to aliasing. In the final part, I worked 
on three interpolation methods—ideal, linear, and cubic spline—and compared how each 
method reconstructs sampled signals in practice. 
Overall, the project helped me build a deeper understanding of signal analysis, time-scaling 
effects, and interpolation behaviour by implementing each step manually and reviewing the 
results in both the time and frequency domains.
